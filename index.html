    <p class="Para">Street lighting plays a crucial role in ensuring safety and security in urban areas. It is an
      indisposable device which can help prevent many accidents and injuries. These days street lights are used in a
      huge number of places and to great effect. However, traditional street lighting systems are often inefficient and
      consume a significant amount of energy by staying on all the time such as shown in the figure to the right. To
      address these issues, we have created a smart street lighting system as a solution that utilizes technology and
      automation to optimize energy consumption.</p>

    <h2 class="Heading">Usage of Smart Street Lights</h2>
    <p>Our smart street lighting system uses sensors and controls to improve the efficiency, safety, and sustainability
      of street lighting. These smart street lights are equipped with LED lights and sensors. The sensors can detect
      things like vehicles and people on the roads. Then the control system uses this data to give or stop the light
      output of the street lights.This also ensures that they are only on when they are needed.</p>

    <h2 class="Heading">Advantages of this Street Lighting System</h2>
    <p>Our street light system offers many benifits in the long run, which include but are not limited to -
    <ul>
      <li>The street light system turns on only when needed, being able to save substantial electricity and thus money.
        This is very useful in roads that are not used during nights.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it is very cheap to implement only requiring a few items. It also has simple circuits and
        programming, enabling it to be installed easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, the electricity it saves helps in reducing ghg emmisions.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Overall, we believe our smart street lighting system offers numerous benefits like energy efficiency, cost
      savings and improved safety. By using technology and automation to our benifit, these systems can transform
      traditional street lighting into a more sustainable and intelligent infrastructure in the future.</p>
